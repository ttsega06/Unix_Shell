# Basic Unix Shell
This is a basic unix shell with three built in commands: cd (change directory), pwd (print working directory), and exit. 
External commands are handled by a function called execExternal that tokenizes the input arguments, creates a child process using fork(),
 passes the arguments to the child process using execvp, and then waits for the child to terminate.
